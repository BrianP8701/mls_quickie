(Note that the Roof Doctors report said the roof had 10 years left but gave an absurdly high estimate for seemingly minor repairs, so the sellers had another roof inspection, which came in 90% lower). The home is priced for an as-is sale, as most updated Maxwell Park homes sell for several hundred thousand more. The seller already has a sewer compliance certificate. Oakland also has a sidewalk ordinance and the seller's 2022 sidewalk inspection quoted $4,755 to perform required sidewalk repairs. If buyer takes responsibility for the sidewalk, they have 120 days after COE to complete the work. Oakland's City Transfer Tax is $15/$1,000, which is customarily split 50/50 between buyer & seller.

Located in the Maxwell Park area of Oakland, this single level home just began its second century of life. And it's definitely a step back in time...to a simpler era, when building materials were crafted by artisans and installed by master carpenters. For starters, there are original hardwood floors throughout most of the home. The dining room has the 1920s written all over it, with a dramatic coffered ceiling, custom wall panels and a built-in buffet / dining hutch. The custom wood-framed picture windows add elegance and comfort to the living room, while the fireplace adds cozy winter-time warmth. The large open country kitchen is just off the dining room and features gas cooking. There's also an interior laundry & utility room on the opposite side of the kitchen. While most of the home retains its classic 1920s style and allure, the home has some modern conveniences, too, including central heat. There's also a long driveway on the left side of the house, with ample room to park several cars.
