It's a rare single-level, level-in version of the Cascade, and it offers both a garage and a carport conveniently located just outside the front door. The living room is surprisingly spacious for a level-in condo and features a vaulted ceiling, adding to the sense of openness. Additionally, an extra spacious den has been added, increasing the model's square footage by over 200 square feet.  The unit has been updated with modern features such as smooth ceilings, Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP) flooring, recessed LED lighting, and fresh paint. Outside, the expanded patio has been recently refinished with new slate tiles, providing a wonderful outdoor space overlooking the golf course. The primary bathroom has been remodeled so that the shower is larger and easier to access, even for someone who needs the assistance of walker.
