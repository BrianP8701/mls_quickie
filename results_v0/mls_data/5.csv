Behind the gate, the bustle of the city fades away. A lush, walled garden appears. Wild bursts of green surround the soft splash of a fountain, and a charming bridge carries you over a lily pond and into the sanctuary of home. With cacti, water plants, mature trees, and a private and secluded feel, this is a memorable slice of nature and Zen. Tucked away in the rear of the lot is a shingle-sided cottage with a modern interior. Upstairs is all clean lines and open floor plan, flooded with light. Feast on views of Twin Peaks and Sutro Tower from the dining room. The kitchen boasts Miele and Bosch appliances, an island that's a natural gathering point, and chic, current finishes. The spacious walk-out deck is private and wind-protected, creating an enviable indoor/outdoor vibe. Truly an al fresco extension of the living space, it's destined to host many morning coffees, meals with friends, and sunset unwind times. Watch the fog hang over Twin Peaks while you enjoy the sun in the city's best microclimate. Downstairs, the king-sized master suite has ample room for a WFH space. The tranquility of the garden outside the windows is the ideal. Include a freshly updated en suite bath and a massive walk-in closet.
